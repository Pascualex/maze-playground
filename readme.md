# Maze Playground
Interactive project in an early stage. You can access the live version [here](https://pascualex.github.io/maze-playground/).

### Previous version of this project
Some time ago, I developed a similar concept in Java and Swing. It was not interactable and the only available feature was to generate the mazes. I can be found [here](https://github.com/Pascualex/maze-generator).
